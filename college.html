                        <h2>College: Fly-In Programs & Scholarships & Interviews</h2>
                        <p>Fly-ins are all-expenses paid, multi-day programs at colleges for seniors to explore the school. These apps can open in early August, so be sure to google the schools you're interested in to see if they have these programs. The process usually includes an essay or two, and some of them even offer you a chance to interview there. So if you're accepted, make sure to prepare the following questions: why do you want to go to our school? What would you bring to the table? What are some of your leadership experiences? Tell me about a time you made a mistake.</p>
                        <p>It's also helpful to look for scholarships the summer after your junior year! The most popular ones (which are also very competitive!) are Gates, Coca-Cola, and Ron Brown. You can google "best scholarships for high school seniors" to find more options. You can also reach out to your guidance counselor and tell them you are interested in scholarships. They can give you some suggestions!</p>
                        <p>To prepare for your interview, be in the interviewer's shoes and think about questions that they may ask. In addition to the questions mentioned in the first paragraph, reflect on the clubs/activities you are a part of and write about your main academic/extracurricular interests in bullet points. Ask yourself what did I do in this club? What impact did I have? Also, google "popular college interview questions" and write out your answers for those as well. Don't be discouraged if your friends are getting interviews before you do. How long it takes for you to get an interview may depend on the area you live in (i.e. people living in cities typically get their interviews quicker because there are more alumni there than in rural/suburban areas).</p>
                        <p>IN SUMMARY: Apply to fly-in programs, scholarships, and write out + answer the most common college interview questions to prepare!</p>

                        <h2>College: Succeeding Freshman Year</h2>
                        <p>Congrats on getting into college! The first couple weeks can be very busy with mandatory events and move-in. But, what can really relieve stress is to determine the clubs you want to join, classes you'd like to take, and majors you're considering before you get to campus! Once you get on campus, look for opportunities to connect with professors and establish good relationships with your course assistants. These relationships can help you down the road when you are seeking advice for choosing courses or recommendation letters. Be sure to stay on top of your email!</p>
                        <p>Time management is critical. In college, you're pretty much on your own compared to high school. Each day, I create a plan for things I need to do and have made Google Calendar my best friend! Make sure to go to Office Hours and seek help when you need it! Ask about any free or low-cost tutoring services available for you to do homework and prepare for exams. College work, or problem sets as they're often called, is harder than high school work. They're often designed for group work because they're almost always impossible to do on your own.</p>
                        <p>IN SUMMARY: Decide on clubs/classes/potential majors before college starts, establish strong relationships with faculty, and manage your time wisely! Best of luck :)</p>
